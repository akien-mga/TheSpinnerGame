Welcome to The Spinner Game's Home!

The Spinner Game is a product of the collective efforts of Gautam Agarwal, Marta Ferreira and Tiago Quendera, and developed at the Systems Neuroscience Laboratory, Champalimaud Research in Lisboa, Portugal.

-The game's inital version (on branch "construct2") was developed using Scirra's Construct2 engine, available to try at https://www.scirra.com/construct2.

-A second version, on the "discrete" branch was developed using Scirra's Construct3 engine available to try at https://construct.net.

-The current version is being developed in the open-source Godot game engine. It is currently being developed on the 3.0-alpha1 version of the engine. Download and find more about it at https://godotengine.org/.

Aforementioned game engine software is necessary to run the code in all the branches of this repository.
