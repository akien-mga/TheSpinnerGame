# TheSpinnerGame

Welcome to The Spinner Game's Home!

The Spinner Game is a product of the collective efforts of Gautam Agarwal, Marta Ferreira and Tiago Quendera, all working at the Systems Neuroscience Laboratory, Champalimaud Research in Lisboa, Portugal.

The game is developed using Scirra's Construct2 engine, available to try at https://www.scirra.com/construct2. This software is required to run the code in this repository.
